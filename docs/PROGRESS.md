# Development Progress Summary

## 🎯 Current State (June 2025)

### What's Working ✅

**Authentication System**
- Discord OAuth fully functional via NextAuth.js
- User sessions persist correctly
- Database integration working (PostgreSQL on unRAID server)
- User can sign in/out successfully

**Campaign Management**
- Campaign creation API endpoint (`/api/campaigns`) working
- Campaign creation form (`/campaigns/new`) functional
- Database schema complete with proper relationships
- Player-character mapping system implemented

**Core Infrastructure** 
- Next.js 14 app with TypeScript
- Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL database
- Environment configuration working (dev + production)
- Git repository structure organized

**Database Connection**
- Successfully connected to unRAID PostgreSQL server
- Credentials: `postgresql://ezekiel:Jenny092410@192.168.86.20:5432/worldbuilder`
- Prisma migrations and schema pushes working

### Current Issues ❌

**UI/Styling Problems**
- Large purple element appearing on dashboard (layout broken)
- Icons displaying too large or incorrectly positioned
- Custom CSS conflicts with Tailwind causing rendering issues
- Dark theme implementation causing visual problems
- Non-responsive layout on mobile devices

**Component Integration**
- UserMenu dropdown styling inconsistent
- Auth components not properly themed
- Layout wrapper conflicts between custom CSS and Tailwind

### Architecture Decisions Made

**Tech Stack Confirmed**
- **Frontend/Backend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM  
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with Discord OAuth
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (custom CSS causing issues)
- **Deployment**: Manual git push to Pi 4 production

**Audio Processing Strategy**
- **Two-step approach validated**: Audio → Transcript → Summary
- **Cost confirmed**: ~$0.39 per 4-hour session
- **API**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash with Files API
- **Integration pending**: Need to port existing Node.js script to Next.js API routes

**Database Schema**
- User management via NextAuth tables
- Campaign system with owner/member relationships  
- Session processing with status tracking
- Player-character mapping as JSON fields

## 🔄 Next Priority Actions

### Immediate (Current Thread)
1. **Fix UI/Styling Issues**
   - Debug large purple element on dashboard
   - Simplify CSS to use only Tailwind classes
   - Ensure responsive design works properly
   - Test campaign creation flow end-to-end

### Short Term (Next Thread)
2. **Complete Campaign Management**
   - Campaign editing functionality
   - Campaign member management
   - Campaign dashboard/detail view
   - Session history display

3. **Audio Processing Integration** 
   - Create `/api/sessions/upload` endpoint
   - Port working Node.js script to Next.js API routes
   - Build file upload UI component
   - Implement processing status tracking

### Medium Term
4. **Session Results Display**
   - Session summary viewer
   - Session history and search
   - Export/sharing functionality

5. **Production Deployment**
   - Test full deployment to Pi
   - PM2 configuration
   - Error monitoring and logging

## 🐛 Known Issues Log

### CSS/Styling Issues
- **Issue**: Large purple element covering dashboard
- **Cause**: Custom CSS variables and complex gradients conflicting with Tailwind
- **Status**: Attempted fix with simplified CSS, needs debugging
- **Priority**: High (blocking basic usage)

### Component Rendering
- **Issue**: Icons and layout elements incorrectly sized
- **Cause**: CSS conflicts between custom properties and Tailwind classes  
- **Status**: Partially addressed, needs complete CSS cleanup
- **Priority**: High

### Responsive Design
- **Issue**: Layout breaks on smaller screens
- **Cause**: Fixed sizes and inadequate responsive classes
- **Status**: Needs systematic mobile-first approach
- **Priority**: Medium
